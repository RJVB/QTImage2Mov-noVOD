QTImage2Mov

QTImage2Mov is an importer component for XML containers listing import commands, as well as
for a very simple image stream container format (JPGS) and a proprietary video format (VOD).

The XML container format allows to specify one or multiple import files as well as to configure
the import procedure (e.g. mask quadrants or flip) and add chapters or other metadata.
Note that this repository does NOT contain the VOD import code which cannot at this time be made
public.
